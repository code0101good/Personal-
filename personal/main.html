                I have a year of experience working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and am excited to continue 
                growing my skills in these areas as I pursue my next opportunity. During my time with HTML, I 
                have become proficient in the language's basic syntax and structure, and have used it to create 
                a variety of web pages, from simple static sites to more complex ones with dynamic content. With
                CSS, I have gained a deep understanding of how to use the language to style and layout web pages, 
                and have created custom stylesheets for a variety of projects. I am well-versed in important 
                concepts like the box model, cascading and specificity, and responsive design techniques. Finally, 
                with Bootstrap, I am comfortable using the popular CSS framework to build responsive, mobile-first 
                websites. I have used Bootstrap to create a variety of projects, from simple marketing sites to 
                more complex web applications, and am experienced with the framework's basic components as well as 
                more advanced features like the navbar, carousel, and modal components. Overall, I am a skilled and 
                dedicated front-end developer who is eager to bring my expertise in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to a 
                new team and help create beautiful, responsive websites that deliver value to users.
